# Online Marketplace Platform

## 1. Services
The platform consists of three core services essential for marketplace operations: **User Service**, **Product Service**, and **Order Service**. Each service should be highly available and able to scale to meet demand. High availablility implies that, each service will run on multiple servers to prevent downtime in case of failures.

A reverse proxy will handle incoming traffic, centralizing HTTPS termination, compression, and providing load balancing across services. This approach also grants more control over public endpoints.

### User Service
This service manages user accounts and authentication.

| Method                | Endpoint                 | Description                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `POST`                | `/users`                 | Create a new user                      |
| `GET`                 | `/users/{id}`            | Retrieve user information by ID        |
| `PUT` and/or `UPDATE` | `/users/{id}`            | Update user details                    |
| `DELETE`              | `/users/{id}`            | Delete a user                          |
| `POST`                | `/users/{id}/auth`       | Authenticate or refresh authentication |
| `POST`                | `/users/{id}/auth-valid` | Check if user credentials are valid    |

### Product Service
This service handles product catalog management.

| Method                | Endpoint                         | Description                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `GET`                 | `/products?limit=100&offset=100` | Retrieve a list of products (with pagination) |
| `GET`                 | `/products/{id}`                 | Retrieve a product by ID                      |
| `PUT` and/or `UPDATE` | `/products/{id}`                 | Update a product by ID                        |
| `DELETE`              | `/products/{id}`                 | Delete a product                              |

### Order Service
This service manages order creation and tracking.

| Method                | Endpoint       | Description                                        |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `POST`                | `/orders`      | Create a new order                                 |
| `PUT` and/or `UPDATE` | `/orders/{id}` | Update an order                                    |
| `DELETE`              | `/orders/{id}` | Delete an order                                    |
| `GET`                 | `/orders/{id}` | Retrieve order details (with tracking information) |

## 2. Database
A SQL database is recommended for all services initially due to its reliability. The database system can evolve as the platform grows:

- **Product Service**: Primarily handles read-heavy traffic. In the future, read replicas can be used to scale horizontally if necessary. For scenarios with a large number of products or frequent updates, a NoSQL solution could be considered.

- **User Service**: Likely does not require horizontal scaling initially. If the system grows globally, sharding or regionally distributed databases can be introduced to reduce latency.

- **Order Service**: Must maintain strict ACID compliance to prevent data corruption during payment or order processing. Therefore a proven SQL Database will be used.

## 3. Scaling Considerations
- **User Service**: Horizontal scaling is likely unnecessary, but if required, data can be sharded across multiple databases. Geographic replication may improve latency for users in different regions.

- **Product Service**: The load balancer can spawn new instances based on traffic volume to handle peak demand. Most operations are read-heavy, so scaling read replicas would be sufficient for normal operations.

- **Order Service**: This service is critical to the checkout process and represents a potential bottleneck during peak times. To mitigate this, a queue-based buffering system will be implemented to handle spikes in order volume. Additional service nodes can be spun up dynamically to process queued orders when needed.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline
As long as the services operate in the context of this marketplace, a monorepo approach is recommended, where all services reside in a single Git repository. Each service will have its own **Dockerfile** for building production-ready containers, and pipelines should be set up to automate testing and deployment.

The pipeline and deployment specifics are highly dependent on the target git/cloud service. Either way the steps will share a common workflow.

### Pipeline Workflow
1. **Build & Test**: Each service is built and tested independently using unit and integration tests.
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Once services pass their individual tests, end-to-end tests will verify system-wide functionality.
3. **Deployment**: Upon successful testing, services are deployed. Docker containerization ensures portability. For example when using AWS, ECS/EKS could be used to run/orchestrate the containers.
